# My tablets

## Overview

* The **spreadsheet** linked below is a list of all my tablets that I currently own&#x20;
  * ([https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=C2CAE95D828B7C69!297\&ithint=file%2cxlsx\&authkey=!APHMJTuS-Hg0HjA](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=C2CAE95D828B7C69!297\&ithint=file%2cxlsx\&authkey=!APHMJTuS-Hg0HjA))
* All of these tablets are **personal purchases**. None of the tablets were provided by a manufacturer or gifted to me.
* Many tablets were purchased used from eBay
* I use [**OpenTabletDriver**](../guides/drivers/opentabletdriver/) instead of the manufacturer driver for older tablets:
  * Their original drivers may be unavailable
  * Their original drivers may no longer work well on recent versions of Windows
  * The most recent drivers sometimes explicitly drop support for those older tablets
