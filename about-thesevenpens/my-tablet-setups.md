# My tablet setups

I have several setups ready for testing and trying out drawing tablets. It varies over time and what I am doing. Below is my latest setup as of 2023/08/03.

* (1) PC with Huion Kamvas 22 plus and Huion Giano G930L. Both tablets are hooked up at the same time.
* (2) Laptop (Microsoft Surface Pro 8) with a XP-Pen Deco Pro XLW 2nd Gen
* (3) PC (Minisforum HX99G) with a Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) and a Wacom Cintiq Pro 27. Both tablets are hooked up at the same time.
* (4) Laptop (Microsoft Surface Pro 8) with a Huion HS611
* (5) Mac Studio - I swap the tablets from #3 to this machine when I need to test MacOS &#x20;

## Notes

* Setup #1 is reserved for remote work. I keep it completely separate from my personal machines.
