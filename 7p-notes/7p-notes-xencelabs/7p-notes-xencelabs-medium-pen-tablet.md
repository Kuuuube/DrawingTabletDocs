# 7P notes: Xencelabs Medium Pen Tablet

**Summary**

Had a good experience with this tablet after using for six months.

It's in the same price range as Wacom.

**Build quality** - very solid. Comparable to Wacom Intuos Pro.

**Basic drawing** - very good. I forgot I wasn't using a Wacom Intuos Pro tablet.

**Diagonal wobble** - did not test.

**Driver** - Driver UX is very friendly and modern in appearance.
