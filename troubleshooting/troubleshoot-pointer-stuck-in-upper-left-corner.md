# Troubleshoot pointer stuck in upper-left corner

It's unclear what causes this but people I found success fixing it once. &#x20;

## What worked for me

I had this problem occur with an Huion HS611 tablet.

I fixed it by temporarily setting the active area (what Huion calls the Working area) to the full screen and then back to its previous setting.
