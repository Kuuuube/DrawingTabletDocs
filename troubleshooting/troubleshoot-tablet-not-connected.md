# Troubleshoot tablet not connected

**IMPORTANT**: If you are seeing a "NO SIGNAL" message, go here: [**Troubleshoot No Signal**](troubleshoot-no-signal.md).&#x20;

## Overview

The "tablet not connected" problem is fundamentally that your computer cannot "see" the device even though it is plugged in via USB cable.

## Troubleshooting options

* Restart the computer. This sometimes resolves the problem.
* Unplug and re-plug the USB cable
* Try a different USB port.
* Try a different USB cable - make sure the USB cable supports data and not just power.
* Look at the USB ports and verify they are clean and remove and lint,etc. that you find
* Uninstall and reinstall the driver
* If you are using a pen display verify it is getting enough power.
* If none of these options are helping then [**contact support**](../guides/general/contacting-support.md).

## Notes

* When you plug in the tablet or unplug the tablet, check if the computer makes a "beep". This at least indicates that the computer is aware that there is some device there.
* Sometimes this problem is sporadic. I've had it personally occur with a tablet and after about 30 minutes of restarts, things just started working again.
* Test with another computer. If it works with the other computer then it may help sort out where the problem is.
* Some vendors like Huion recommend disabling antivirus when reinstalling the drivers. I do not recommend this, but some people say it has helped.
