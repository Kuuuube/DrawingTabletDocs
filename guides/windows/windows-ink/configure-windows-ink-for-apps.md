## Adobe Photoshop

Older versions of Photoshop supported disabling the use of windows Ink by using a "PSUserConfig.txt" file.

As of 2023 the most recent versions of Photoshop no longer respect the Winks Ink setting in PSUserConfig.txt and Photoshop requires the use of Windows Ink in your tablet driver.
