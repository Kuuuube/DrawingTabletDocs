# Active area

## Introduction

The active area of a drawing tablet is the rectangle region of the tablet's surface that is sensitive to the EMR pen.

When we talk about the "size" of the drawing tablet, we are referring to the active area.

## Active area of pen tablets

The active area of a pen tablet is usually designated by marks on the surfaceof the tablet. Usually it will be either at the four corners of the active area or there will be a pattern of dots across the entire active area.

## Active area of pen displays

The active area of a pen display is very easy to detect because it is the exact the same area of the display panel.

## Size

Usually when we discuss the size of an active area, we talk about its diagonal length. Drawing tablets vary quite a bit in their active area size. More here: [**Active area size**](active-area-size.md)&#x20;

## Aspect Ratio

The relationship between the width and height of the active area is its aspect ratio. More here: [**Active area aspect ratio**](active-area-aspect-ratio.md).
