# Erasing

## Pens with erasers

**Some** EMR pens have an eraser at the other end of the nib. This eraser is essentially just a thicker nib.

* **Huion** - As far as I know, none of the Huion pens have an eraser on the end.
* **XP-Pen** - XP-Pen has at least one model that does have an eraser: P06 [https://www.xp-pen.com/product/75.html](https://www.xp-pen.com/product/75.html)
* **Wacom** - Wacom Pro Pens typically have an eraser. For example a Pro Pen 2 (KP-504E) [https://estore.wacom.com/en-US/wacom-pro-pen-2-with-pen-case-kp504e.html](https://estore.wacom.com/en-US/wacom-pro-pen-2-with-pen-case-kp504e.html)

Keep in mind:

* Drawing apps have to know what to do with the eraser, and not all make use of the eraser function.
* Remember that a specific tablet is compatible with only specific pens. Avoid buying a pen that has an eraser and assuming it will work with your tablet. Always check with the manufacturer.

## Using the side buttons to erase

Another option is to map the side buttons to switch to the eraser tool in the app you are using. You can do this in the tablet driver app.
