# Pen hover

## Overview&#x20;

In the context of drawing tablets, it means if the pen's position can be detected even if the pen doesn't touch the tablet and whether you can see the brush outline/cursor while the pen hovers.

All drawing tablets - like a Wacom Intuos or a Wacom Cintiq - support pen hover.
