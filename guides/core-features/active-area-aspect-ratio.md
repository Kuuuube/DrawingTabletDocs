# Active area aspect ratio

## Introduction

The aspect ratio of your drawing tablet's [**active area**](active-area.md), can have a big impact on how good it feels to draw on them.

## Basics

Any rectangular area has an aspect ratio. Which is the relationship between the width and height. Usually we will express the AR as a ratio like 16:9 or 16x9.&#x20;

Displays (monitors) tend to have aspect ratios like 16x9 and 16x10. 16x9 is the most common aspect ratio.

## Aspect ratio mismatches with pen tablets

The issue with pen tablets is that the tablet and the display are separate devices. And each has its own aspect ratio.

If the aspect ratios coincidentally match, then there is no distortion when you draw.

But unfortunately, there is almost always some noticable distortion.

Here is the most common one:

* the tablet has AR=16:10
* the display has AR = 16:9

Here are some examples of what happens some Wacom pen tablets because of the mismatched aspect ratios.

## Forcing the aspect ratios to match on pen tablets

### Wacom

* Launch **Wacom Tablet Properties**
* Under the **Mapping** tab, enable **Force Proportions**&#x20;

### Huion

* Launch the **HuionTablet App**
* Go to **Working Area**&#x20;
* On the bottom left there is a drop down.&#x20;
* Switch the dropdown to **Screen Ratio**.

### Gaomon

* Open the Gaomon driver app
* Go to **Workspace**
* Select **Screen Ratio**

### XP-Pen

* Open the XP-Pen driver app (called **PenTablet**)
* Go to **Work Area**
* Go to **Pen Tablet**
* Select **Proportion**



## Pen displays and aspect ratios

The active area of a pen display and their display panel inside the pen display are equivalent. So they always match.



## Reference

### A survey of aspect ratios of Wacom pen tablets

As of 2023, NONE of Wacom's pen tablets have an exact 16:9 aspect ratio.
