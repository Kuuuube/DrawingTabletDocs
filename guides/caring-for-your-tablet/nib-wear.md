# Nib wear

## Causes of nib wear

Fundamentally nib wear is due to friction caused by the nib moving against the tablet surface.

## Examples

Below you can see the wear on an Wacom Art Pen nib which has been used on a Wacom Intuos Pro Large (PTH-860) surface after two weeks.&#x20;

## Surface texture

The amount of texture on the tablet surface will affect how fast the nib wears down.

Some tablets are more textured and some less.&#x20;

Some people like a little more rough surface because to them it feels like paper while others like a really smooth surface like glass.&#x20;

## Pressing heavily

Some people draw "heavy-handed" and put a lot of pressure on their nib.

## Drawing style

Some people a have drawing style that features lots of strokes drawn over and over. This can cause a nib to wear down fast.

For me what works best is just buying more nibs because they are cheap and easy to replace.

## Preventing or slowing nib wear

Try drawing with less pressure. You can change the pressure curve in your driver to help lessen the need to press down so hard.

If you are doing a lot of back and forth strokes to fill in an area, that repeated motion of the pen can wear down the nib fast. Consider using some other way of filling in an area.

Some tablets like the Wacom Intuos Pro have replaceable **texture sheets**. In Wacom's case there are three texture styles: standard, smooth, rough. Try the smooth texture sheet.

Try a smoother protective sheet over your tablet.
