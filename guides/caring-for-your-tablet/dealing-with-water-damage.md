# Dealing with water damage

## General advice

* See this page: [https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Electronics\_Water\_Damage](https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Electronics\_Water\_Damage)
* Leave the pen/tablet to draw dry for at least 48 hours. Keeping it in a dry warm (but not hot) place will help.

## Tablet

* if your tablet is connected with any cables, disconnect the cables.
* If your tablet is connected wirelessly, it may have an on/off button. Turn it off.

## Pen

* Remove the nib to help it dry faster
* Keep the pen upright with the nib removed and pointed down to help drain water
* Some pens buttons are a "rocker" type which can be removed and put back in. if you are confident you won't harm your pen this is one option.
* Some people, disassemble their pens - but only try this if you find a good reference on YouTube and are confident around electronics.&#x20;
