# Taking notes with drawing tablets

If you need to take notes and especially if you need to be mobile, then in my opinion pen tablets and pen displays aren't great at this task.&#x20;

### Key negatives of using pen tablets for note taking

* small pen tablets don't offer much space for writing and it can feel cramped. A medium pen tablet is better, but then it takes up much more space.
* pen tablets - because they have no screen - can be awkward to take notes on as you cannot directly see what you are writing.

### Key negatives of using pen displays for note taking

* Pen displays need to be connected to a computer. Although many pen tablets can work wirelessly.
* Pen displays need to be connected to a significant source of power. Even if the tablet can get power from a computer, a laptop may not supply enough power (even if the laptop is plugged into power) or the power requirement may drain the laptop battery quickly.
* Ideally you would use a single cable to connect a pen display to a computer. But for various reasons this is not always possible. As an alternative you may be required to have a more complex cabling arrangement - often using a 3-in-1 cable. More here about [**using one USB-C cable with a pen display**](../pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display-with-one-usb-c-cable.md).&#x20;
* Pen displays have a lot of cursor lag - this can be very difficult to deal with when taking notes - especially if you write fast. More here: [**lag**](../core-features/lag.md) &#x20;
* If you are note taking in a location where you might drop your pen display, in many cases you will either experience a cracked screen or simply break the tablet entirely. &#x20;

## Alternatives

There are better devices for note taking:

* iPad (one that can use the Apple Pencil or Apple Pencil 2)&#x20;
* Microsoft Surface Pro tablets.
