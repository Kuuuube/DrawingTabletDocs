# Electromagnetic Interference

## Introduction

Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) can occur between your tablet and other devices.

## Other devices interfering with tablets

* Magnets inside devices can cause the pen to skip or warp around areas
  * Example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/13yef7f](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/13yef7f/comment/jmq2jbd/?context=3)
  * Example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/comments/14joyq5/pen\_skips\_across\_the\_screen\_in\_certain\_spots\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XPpen/comments/14joyq5/pen\_skips\_across\_the\_screen\_in\_certain\_spots\_help/)
* Cell phones can prevent the pen from functioning smoothly

## Tablets interfering with other devices

* A wireless mouse might have trouble working near some tablets
* A tablet might interfere with your WiFi network connection

## Other interactions

* I have a keyboard, that when I unplug its usb-C cable will act like a pen and control the position of the pointer on one of my tablets.
