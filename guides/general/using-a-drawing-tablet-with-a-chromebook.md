<mark style="color:red;">**7P: I don't have any personal experience using tablets with Chromebooks. Try to find videos of people's experiences with them in daily usage and not promo or review videos.**</mark>&#x20;

Apparently YES. But it depends on the tablet you have. You need to verify the compatibility with your tablet manufacturer.
