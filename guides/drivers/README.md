# Drivers

For you to fully use the features of your drawing tablet you need to install drivers in your computer.

## Using a tablet without drivers

Windows and Macs do not have built in drivers for drawing tablets.

If you plug the tablet into a Windows or Mac, then one of two things will happen:

* The drawing tablet won't work at all
* Or you will be able to use the pen to point and maybe to click. But there won't be any pressure sensitivity, or tilt. Drawing with it usually won't be very smooth. The computer just treats the drawing tablet as a kind of mouse.

## OpenTabletDriver

* An alternative to manufacturer-provided drivers is **OpenTabletDriver** ([https://opentabletdriver.net/](https://opentabletdriver.net/))
* If you want to try OpenTabletDriver on Windows for use with creative applications, I wrote an detailed [**OpenTabletDriver Installation guide for Windows**](opentabletdriver/opentabletdriver-windows.md).
