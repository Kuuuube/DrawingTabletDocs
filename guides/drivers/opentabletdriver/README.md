## Why use OpenTabletDriver?

Ideally, you should use your manufacturer-provided driver for your tablet. However, there are some situations where OpenTabletDriver is useful or required.&#x20;

* Your manufacturer dropped support for your tablet model with their latest drivers. This may leave you stuck with a tablet you can't use.
* Your manufacturer's drivers may be malfunctioning in some way that is beyond your control to fix.
* You are trying to troubleshoot a problem and want to see if the problem is in the driver vs some other component.
