# Pen buttons

## Number of buttons

* The vast majority of drawing tablet pens have two buttons.&#x20;
* Though some consumer Wacom models have only a single button.&#x20;
* A few pens have three buttons - for example a Wacom Pro Pen 3

## Default two buttons configuration&#x20;

These are the default settings for Wacom pens with two buttons.

* lower button (the one closer to the nib) set to perform a **mouse right-click**
* upper button (the one further away from the nib) set to perform a **mouse double-click**

## Other configurations for pen buttons

&#x20;Other things people configure their buttons to do:

* send a **CTRL-Z keypress** to perform UNDO
* send a **mouse left click**
* send a **SPACE** key

What the buttons do is function of how they are configured in the tablet driver and how the application is configured.  For example, holding down SPACE in many apps will pan the drawing canvas.&#x20;
