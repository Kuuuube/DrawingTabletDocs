# Wacom tablet models

## Wacom's official current tablet models

You can see a list of all the tablets Wacom currently sells on their website ([https://www.wacom.com](https://www.wacom.com)). However, this information does not cover the tablets they historically sold.

## Kuuube's Wacom Tablet Mastersheet

So, if you want the full list, see Kuuube's Wacom tablet mastersheet: ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAFPjGj0ThthPBvOSVVwOm08HW3qWtVoP1iFBwLMyPI/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAFPjGj0ThthPBvOSVVwOm08HW3qWtVoP1iFBwLMyPI/))

Notes:

* This really is an amazing spreadsheet and you won't find some of this information ANYWHERE else.
* The top part of the spreadsheet covers consumer tablets
* The bottom part of the spreadsheet covers professional tablets
* The models are listed by **model identifier** (i.e. model number). If you want to see the **model name(s)** associated with that model hover over the model identifier and a small tooltip will appear with the model name(s).
* Some pens have information Kuuube has measured about the **pressure range**. So for some you will get a good idea about the **initial activation force**.
* **Compatible nibs** are listed
* **Compatible pens** are listed
