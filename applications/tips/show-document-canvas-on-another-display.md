# Show document canvas on another display

## Introduction

Sometimes you may want to see the same canvas on two displays.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-19 032531.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is useful in a couple of cases:

* Work on the canvas on display A, but see a full screen version of the canvas on display B
* &#x20;Work on the full screen version on display A, but show the canvas on display B so that you can access the rest of the application's UI.

Some applications support this generic capability of putting the canvas on two displays simultaneously, but not all do.

Here are the ones I have confirmed that do support it: Krita, Photoshop.

Instructions below

## Krita instructions

Let's say you have a document window already open called \<title>\


Click **Window > New Window**&#x20;

* This creates a second new Krita application window that will have no documents in it.&#x20;
* Go to the original Krita application window and **Click Window > New View \<title>**
* Now you will see the document **\<title>** on both application windows.&#x20;
* Then you can draw on that document in either application window.
* Any changes to the document in one window will be reflected in the other.

## Photoshop instructions

* If you have a document window already open called **\<title>**
* Use **Window > Arrange >** New Window for **\<title>**
* Now you will have two windows for the same document&#x20;
* Drag either window to a second display and maximize the window.&#x20;
* Then you can use either window to edit the document.
