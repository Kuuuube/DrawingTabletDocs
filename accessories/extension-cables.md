# Extension cables

### Overview

Sometimes your cable's just aren't long enough. to solve that problem you can purchase extension cables.&#x20;

You just have to make sure that the cable you purchase supports what you need. For example, an extension cable for a pen tablet is very easy to Purchas because a en tablet doesn't require much power or data. However, if you want to use an USB-C extension cable for a pen display, you may need to ensure that is supports sending enough power or a display signal depending on hwo you intend to use the cable.

To better understand the needs of connecting a pen display see: [**Connecting a pen display**](../guides/pen-displays/connecting-a-pen-display.md).

## The extension cable I use for pen displays

I use a 2 foot UseBean USB-C Extension cable. This product has worked well for me. I connect it to the USB-C end of a Huion 3-in-1 cable and use it with my Huion Kamvas 22 Plus.

It meets my needs because it carries enough data, power, and  display signal for my tablet.
